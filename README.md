# Chessboard-Queens-Problem
Program that creates a NxN chessboard and gibes all possible placements of the Queens on the chessboard so that no Queen is in the path of any other Queen

Program returns the number of possible solutions to Queen placements on an NxN chessboard. The user can also decide to have all possible solutions printed out by letting the program entering verbose mode. Also program needs to be ran in terminal otherwise it will not work. Any invalid inputs will prompt the user with insturctions on how to use the program.

Not much real use of this; it's more just a fun little solution to an algorithm.
